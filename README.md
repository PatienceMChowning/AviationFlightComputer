Note: This flight computer will give a general solution to finding airspeed, time en route, as well as basic information regarding any plane. It will also give specific information regarding the Piper Cub and the Piper Arrow.

Introduction: 
The Aviation Flight Computer is a tool that will simplify two basic E6B calculations, airspeed and time en route. Using an E6B can become strenuous and tiresome over time so the use of the Aviation Flight Computer will ease your troubles and save you time. This flight computer aims to calculate and provide a “rough” estimate of both airspeed and time en route for any plane. It will also provide basic information regarding the Piper Cub and the Piper Arrow.

This project focuses on the use of Object Oriented Programming.
